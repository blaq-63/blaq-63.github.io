            <script src="greeter.js"></script>So, I will give you a little some'n some'n about myself. My name is Hylton Nuetey Carboo. Well, most administrative people know me as "Hilton" mainly because of some crappy mistake. Anywho, this website started as a class project, however, I got bored and got an idea.
        </p>

        <p>My first semester in UML was crappy mainly because I didn't know a lot things. I didn't know how to use a MAKEFILE, my ability to use LINUX commands was garbage, I couldn't use functions by typing them from memory because I relied heavily on auto-complete.</p>

        <p>So just so I have something interesting to do, I will be creating a tutorial for thigs that every in coming UMass Lowell Computer Science students should know. Additionally, depndeding on how well this semester goes I <em>may</em> provide tutorials for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQUERY. They are what I will be studying during this fall semster for my Graphical User Interface Class. <a href="html_pages/linux_comm.html">Click here to get started.</a></p>
